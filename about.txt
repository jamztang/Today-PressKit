# Today Release Notes 1.0

Today app is a patiently crafted Pomodoro Timer + Personal Daily Target List.
To improve on the Pomodoro Technique®, I consider the app should focus on three major areas that should provide to further improve our productivity.

## Plan:
Easily listing out your daily achievables and customize sessions length.

## Focus:
One tap to start timer, and have delightful notification when the session is done.

## Review:
Should be able to quickly glance at your daily progress, and optionally logs the event into your selected calendar.

## Feature Overview

When you finish your day, you can simply start over by pulling down from the dashboard to clear the stats.

I've also been put a lot of effort on those finishing effects and putting on screen tips right at the spot without blocking your flow.

The Apple Watch version is also great for quick glance and basic time session control, and it syncs instantly with your iPhone companion app.

## Background
